## Feedback on Assignment
* Its a great experience working on this assignment. Working on new class like SimpleText made me learn different types of execution methods.
* Although we have SimpleText to pass text data, since it can pass a preloaded set of questions, I have also included a conversational chatbot feature.
* I have created a text file with information on science and applied NLP techniques such as tokenization, lemmatization, and cosine similarity on the text.
* The chatbot answers the questions based on the cosine similarity of the text.
